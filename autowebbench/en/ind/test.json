Grey also mentioned that the July 31 court decision is going to expose the Alberta government to substantial civil liability.> <p| Grey said that if governments exceed the limits of authority granted to them, the courts will declare the laws illegal or invalid.> <p| That is a fundamental recognition of the rule of law, and that is what has been missing from Canadian jurisprudence for three years, continued Grey. This decision tells government: Your powers have limits. This is the first time that government overreach has been checked.> <iframe| 3rd party ad content> <strong| Pastor James Coates and the Canadian Government> <p| Back in 2020, Coates continued to preach and hold worship services in direct violation of the COVID-19 restrictions set by the Alberta provincial government. At the time, the church had around 400 in attendance. The number of congregants is said to have doubled following the arrest of the pastor.> > > < <img| > < <span| Michael's church in Grundy> <a[CW]| Prepared Pastor 5-Pack> <span| Verified by <a[DW]| ChurchLeaders> > > > >\n\nYou are a helpful assistant that can assist with web navigation tasks.\nYou are given a simplified html webpage and a task description.\nYour goal is to complete the task.

The guide was written by members of the Association for Media Literacy / Canada.> <b| Introduction> <p| The teacher's attitude to the mass media and to students as avid media consumers is crucial to the success of any media literacy program. Most students bring to the classroom an enormous amount of information about and experience with the media -- in many cases, far more than do their teachers. While it is important for teachers to start where their students are, it is also necessary for them to lead their students to where they are not.> <p| This guide stresses teaching inductively and beginning whenever possible with students' direct experiences with the media. The basic method of media studies is that of a \"spiral curriculum\", a concept developed by educator Jerome Bruner. The fundamental principle of this method is that the key concepts of any discipline can be taught in some form to students at any level. Thus, concepts initially introduced in simple form at the elementary level are, in successive years, explored, developed, and> <p| To take a relatively simple example, elementary school pupils might begin to explore the concept of the commercial implications of media by talking about television programs they watch and, with the guidance of the teacher, distinguishing between program material and commercials, identifying the different purposes of each. At a later stage they could look at a variety of commercials aimed at children, discussing their reactions to them and perhaps beginning to evaluate their effectiveness. They > <p| Because students are immersed in media, the role of the teacher must be that of a facilitator and a co-learner. The teacher must help students to negotiate meaning, engage in inquiry and research, identify patterns, and create their own media productions.> > > > > >\n\nYou are a helpful assistant that can assist with web navigation tasks.\nYou are given a simplified html webpage and a task description.\nYour goal is to complete the task.

The first settlers sectioned the land and established one-room schools within a mile or two of most farmsteads. In the 1860s, Iowans chartered the first land-grant institution of higher learning, Iowa State University. Matching Iowa's pioneer spirit, the university's programs are open to all, practical in nature, and available to everyone in the state through extension and outreach.> <font| A century later, Iowa educators again blazed trails in the emerging field of media education with a unique self-directed, module-based curriculum called <i| Media Now> > <font| In the mid-1960s in the small southwest Iowa city of Red Oak, two forward-thinking education entrepreneurs, Bill Horner, a middle school teacher, and Ron Curtis, a K-12 AV specialist, received grant funding to deliver educational audio-visual materials to teachers and classrooms in a multi-county region. The Southwest Iowa Learning Resources Center LRC became a precursor of today's area education agencies and served as a community locus for an innovative film study program.> <font| The LRC housed, scheduled, and delivered daily a collection of instructional resources, including 16mm films, slides, filmstrips, learning kits, overhead transparencies, audio tapes, and books to school districts in nine counties. The staff also received grants to develop original curricula, provide teacher training, and offer community outreach.> <font| By 1968, Curtis' experiences coordinating the media collection, working with K-12 teachers, and leading evening film study classes led him to develop an innovative media curriculum for high school students. The community film study classes led Curtis to three primary project collaborators: Drake University film studies professor Russ Cochran, Iowa State University film history professor Dann Perkins, and Mt. Ayr IA secondary educator Bill Hohlfeld.> <b| Creating <i| Media Now> > > > > > >\n\nYou are a helpful assistant that can assist with web navigation tasks.\nYou are given a simplified html webpage and a task description.\nYour goal is to complete the task.
